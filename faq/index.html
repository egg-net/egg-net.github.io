										<div class="u-margin-bottom-15">The blockchain is a hash-linked data structure. It is the first type of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), which within itself include other different technologies sharing a similar objective. In simple terms, a blockchain is a continuously growing list of records, stored in what are called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography. Bitcoin is the first blockchain ever created.</div>
										<div class="u-margin-bottom-15">A blockchain allows connected computers in a peer-to-peer network to reach agreement over shared data. While it is technologically decentralized, the implementer may have total control over the network. We can then differentiate between open and closed blockchains, depending if anyone can freely join and participate in the network and its consensus mechanism, or if a central party/ consortium controls it. Bitcoin and Stakenet are open blockchains, while banks and other financial institutions are using closed blockchains (or some other sort of closed distributed ledgers). These differences aren’t necessarily good or bad, they just have different use-cases.</div>
										<div class="u-margin-bottom-15">By design, a blockchain is resistant to modification of its data. As said, it is managed by a peer-to-peer network, collectively adhering to a protocol for inter-node communication and validating new blocks. Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without alteration of all subsequent blocks, which requires the consensus of the network majority.</div>
										<div class="u-margin-bottom-15">Bitcoin was the first (open) blockchain to solve the Double Spend Problem without trusting any third parties - this is why the real innovation and value are in open blockchains. While it doesn't seem like a big deal at first, it is actually one of the biggest revolutions in past decades. It has sparkled a transformation in the financial industry with cryptocurrencies and smart contracts, creating an entirely new world out of it, pretty much like the internet back in the day.</div>

								<div class="c-collapse__content">
										<div class="u-margin-bottom-15">A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency designed to work as a medium of exchange - it is money. It uses an open distributed ledger (usually an open blockchain) to secure and verify transactions as well as to control the creation of new units of a particular cryptocurrency.</div>
										<div class="u-margin-bottom-15">The term cryptocurrency was determined by bitcoin (BTC) - the first and leading one. Notice one difference, Bitcoin (uppercase B) is the name of the financial network created using a blockchain, bitcoin (lowercase 'b') or BTC is the coin of this network.</div>
										<div class="u-margin-bottom-15">By definition, a cryptocurrency is open, permissionless, decentralized, trustless, and censorship-resistant. Anyone can freely participate (transact, store) and independently validate its transactions. If it doesn't fit these rules, it is not a cryptocurrency. Using a blockchain or any other type of DLT doesn't make it a cryptocurrency.</div>
										<div class="u-margin-bottom-15">There are some closed, permissioned, and censorable digital coins being created recently, which utilize closed distributed ledgers, and piggyback off being labeled as cryptocurrencies for marketing purposes (e.g. to increase a coin or companies shares value). These are digital coins masquerading around as something they are not, only because they are using Distributed Ledger Technology.</div>
										<div class="u-margin-bottom-15">While closed blockchains are great as they cut down costs and improve speed in the legacy financial sector, they don't come anywhere close to the real innovation that open blockchains bring. The value of a blockchain relies upon its intrinsic asset (cryptocurrency) that is the basis for a game theoretical model of security via consensus algorithms that depend on competition (PoW, PoS, et cetera). The open blockchain is used to achieve the decentralization needed (open participation and validation) for this model of security to work, so no single entity has the power to control the network. On top of that, open blockchains can infinitely scale, provide instant settlements, and be essentially free to transact on, while providing a seamless user experience.</div>
										<div class="u-margin-bottom-15">Don't be fooled by the marketing efforts of corporations with closed blockchains - they are not creating anything as revolutionary as a cryptocurrency, but rather a faster version of permissioned and censorable money (in most cases backed 1:1 by FIAT), using closed Distributed Ledger Technology. This is how the "blockchain, not Bitcoin" nonsense cliché was born; some people either don't understand, or are interested in taking away the real value of open, permissionless, and censorship-resistant money. You must ask yourself why.</div>

										<div class="u-margin-bottom-15">A cryptocurrency wallet is a digital wallet (an application) used to receive, store, and send cryptocurrencies like bitcoin (BTC) and stakenet (XSN).</div>
										<div class="u-margin-bottom-15">It should be noted that a wallet only allows access to the blockchain, where all coins are "stored". So to speak, the wallet is just the medium which stores the private keys, and makes it possible to communicate safely with the blockchain to access certain coins.</div>
										<div class="u-margin-bottom-15">Wallets can be of various types such as an Online wallet (web-based), Mobile wallet, Desktop wallet, Paper wallet, or Hardware wallet. A hardware wallet is a special type of wallet which stores the user's private keys in a secure hardware device. For the average user, it is the most secure wallet of all.</div>

										<div class="u-margin-bottom-15">The private key is the "ticket" that allows someone to spend the Bitcoins (or any other cryptocurrency) associated to it, so it is crucial that these are kept secure. They're automatically generated by each coin's wallet software and can be kept on computer files (usually encrypted within a file called wallet.dat), be printed on paper, or protected within a hardware device (hardware wallet).</div>
										<div class="u-margin-bottom-15">A private key can be generated once by a wallet, and it may be able to "unlock" an almost infinite amount of addresses created thereafter within that wallet using that private key - these are called HD wallets. If you lose the private key, the coins it can unlock will be lost forever. In the early days of Bitcoin, a lot of people lost their private keys, and now there are millions of BTC in the Bitcoin blockchain that can never be recovered.</div>
										<div class="u-margin-bottom-15">The public key is the unique identifier for your cryptocurrency wallet that is known to the public. The address is another identifier, derived from the public key. The address is the identifier people use to send cryptocurrencies to each other.</div>

										<div class="u-margin-bottom-15">Proof of Stake and Proof of Work are both methods used to validate transactions in a blockchain to avoid double spending and fraud.</div>
										<div class="u-margin-bottom-15">The Proof of Work consensus is done by what we call "mining", where the miners have to solve complex mathematical puzzles over and over again. The more computational power (measured in Hashrate), the more chances you have of solving this mathematical problem (the solution is called hash) and earning a reward from the blockchain. It is a way of proving the blockchain that you are investing in it with energy/work.</div>
										<div class="u-margin-bottom-15">Proof of Work (mining) is not a waste of energy or environmentally destructive, as it not only protect Bitcoin and other blockchains, but also encourages humans to search for the most efficient and cheap source of energy possible. Most of the energy used for Bitcoin mining comes from renewable sources or excess of energy that exist in some areas. As Satoshi Nakatomo stated: "The utility of the exchanges made possible by Bitcoin will far exceed the cost of electricity used. Therefore, not having Bitcoin would be the net waste."</div>
										<div class="u-margin-bottom-15">The Proof of Stake consensus is done by minting or forging. In this case, very basic computers can mint or forge (validate transactions) since this is not a very demanding task. Instead of using electricity to prove you are invested in the blockchain, you prove it by owning its coins. Everybody can mint in Proof of Stake systems as it only requires a very cheap computer, online connectivity, and owning some coins of the blockchain you're minting. You don't need to spend huge amounts of money on specialized computers (ASICs) and electricity, like in Proof of Work.</div>

										<div class="u-margin-bottom-15">A Staking node is a computer that runs the coin's wallet with a positive coin balance. The wallet will automatically stake by using the node's resources to protect the blockchain by verifying the legitimacy of the transactions. For its services, the blockchain will send rewards (coin payments). Rewards are based on the number of coins the wallet owns, the more coins the more chances there are to receive a reward. The node must always be online or it won't be staking and therefore not receiving rewards.</div>

										<div class="u-margin-bottom-15">A Masternode is similar to a Staking node, but instead of protecting the network like Staking nodes do, Masternodes provide services to it. They form a huge network of interconnected computers that are used in benefit of the blockchain.</div>
										<div class="u-margin-bottom-15">Each Masternode requires a certain collateral (locked coins) balance to work. In Stakenet, exactly 15 000 XSN per Masternode is required. In our case, XSN Masternodes will hold other blockchains and run XSN Dex, among many other things.</div>
										<div class="u-margin-bottom-15">We can compare a Masternode to a Merchantnode: while in the TPoS process you would find three entities (Owner, Merchant, and Merchantnode) in the Masternode process there's only two, the Owner and the Masternode. There's no need for an intermediate Merchant, as the Owner is the one directly controlling the Masternode. The Merchant entity was purposely added in TPoS so they (merchants) would be able to trustlessly stake Owners coins.</div>
										<div class="u-margin-bottom-15">You can rent an XSN Masternode using our Masternode hosting service in XSN Cloud. It is a trustless solution so you're always in control of your money and there are no associated risks. Since there's no Merchant entity in the Masternode process, as it is in TPoS, you need to deposit some XSN to your Cloud wallet in order for us to take fees for our Masternode hosting service.</div>

										<div class="u-margin-bottom-15">Stakenet is a Lightning Network-ready open-source platform for decentralized applications with its native cryptocurrency – XSN. Its blockchain is custom-built and is infinitely upgradeable to adopt new technological innovations as they develop.</div>
										<div class="u-margin-bottom-15">XSN is digital money, like bitcoin in the Bitcoin blockchain, or ether in Ethereum, as its supply isn’t controlled by any government or company. It is decentralized, secure, scarce, and is used by people all over the world to make payments or as a store of value.</div>
										<div class="u-margin-bottom-15">Stakenet is a Proof of Stake blockchain with Masternodes, which means all stakeholders can help secure and power the network, thus earning a passive income through staking or running a Masternode. Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, which have a high entry barrier due to requiring specialized hardware to mine.</div>
										<div class="u-margin-bottom-15">Thanks to Stakenet’s invention Trustless Proof of Stake, you can stake your coins from cold storage such as a hardware wallet, and receive staking rewards whilst your funds are offline and never at risk - resulting in one of the highest levels of security among any existing blockchain.</div>
										<div class="u-margin-bottom-15">What makes Stakenet and its cryptocurrency XSN stand out?</div>
										<div class="u-margin-bottom-15">It is the first blockchain with Masternodes to ever be Lightning Network ready. This means XSN has instant, virtually feeless, and unlimited transactions per second, making it more valuable than most other cryptocurrencies whose only use-case is speed or scalability. It is also the first, next to Bitcoin and Litecoin, to ever perform Lightning Swaps.</div>
										<div class="u-margin-bottom-15">If Amazon were to accept Bitcoin over the Lightning Network, XSN would automatically be accepted due to its cross-chain capabilities. Essentially you can pay anyone accepting Lightning Network payments with XSN. This is what adoption looks like.</div>
										<div class="u-margin-bottom-15">Stakenet doesn’t want to impose a brand new standard, but rather adhere to the existing Bitcoin-Lightning Network (BTC/LN) protocol. The advantage this provides over others is truly massive: we don't have to hope that our solutions are adopted, they will always be alongside both Bitcoin and the Lightning Network.</div>
										<div class="u-margin-bottom-15">The Stakenet network can run decentralized applications created by anyone over Lightning Network, which is where the future is being built upon.</div>
										<div class="u-margin-bottom-15">These decentralized applications are powered by the Masternodes and directly benefit all XSN holders. The first developed one is a unique Lightning Decentralized Exchange using instant and infinitely scalable Lightning Swaps, where all trading fees collected are automatically used by the network to buy and distribute XSN to the Masternodes. This operates alongside its own TOR network whilst further privacy methods, such as MimbleWimble are continuously being researched.</div>
										<div class="u-margin-bottom-15">Stakenet have an open governance and decentralized self-funding mechanism that allows Masternode holders to cast their votes on development proposals, which are then funded from the network’s treasury.</div>
										<div class="u-margin-bottom-15">You can learn more about XSN in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXj3_qKSUBk" target="_blank">Stakenet video presentation</a>, <a href="../XSN_Comparison_chart.pdf" target="_blank">XSN Comparison chart</a>, and in our dedicated XSN page <a href="../xsn/index.html" target="_blank">https://stakenet.io/xsn</a></div>

										<div class="u-margin-bottom-15">You can stake XSN by leaving your wallet unlocked and running 24/7 with a positive balance, or you can stake with Trustless Proof of Stake. TPoS is a technology developed by Stakenet that allows users to trustlessly stake XSN by having a Merchantnode (a server which acts as a Staking node) do the staking for them while not having to share any spendable balance or private keys with it. This is done with a smart contract.</div>
										<div class="u-margin-bottom-15">With TPoS, you can safely keep your coins anywhere, like in a hardware wallet, and they will be staking and growing over time, even while you sleep. Not having the coins exposed in the staking server is a huge step forward in terms of privacy and security.</div>
										<div class="u-margin-bottom-15">You can run your own Merchantnode to trustlessly stake your own coins, or you can also hire a Merchantnode from a third party to stake your coins for a small fee with no risks associated, as your funds always remain with you. Merchantnodes are provided by independent people called "Merchants" - a whole new market emerged from this technology. You can find them in our social channels, like in our Discord. Keep in mind that a server online 24/7 (Merchantnode) is always needed in order to run TPoS.</div>
										<div class="u-margin-bottom-15">Having trustless and decentralized staking nodes with unique IPv4 addresses makes XSN one of the most secure PoS blockchain. Other cold staking solutions can't achieve this level of security, as they don't have as many nodes verifying the blockchain. Trustless Proof of Stake, in combination with Lightning Swaps, will allow users to stake XSN held in a hardware wallet and earn Bitcoin (or any other LN compatible coin) directly to this hardware wallet as rewards.</div>
										<div class="u-margin-bottom-15">In a TPoS contract there are three entities: the Owner (wallet that owns the coins to be staked), the Merchant (wallet that creates the smart contract with the Owner and earns a commission), and the Merchantnode (the wallet from the Merchant that will be staking in a server online 24/7).</div>
										<div class="u-margin-bottom-15">If you are a Merchant providing services to other Owners, you can use your own local wallet to act as the Merchant wallet where you will earn the commissions from all the TPoS contracts you have created - this Merchant's wallet, as well as the Owner's wallet, can both remain offline. Then you will have servers online 24/7 running the wallets acting as Merchantnodes and staking each Owner's coins.</div>
										<div class="u-margin-bottom-15">If you are the Owner and want to TPoS your own coins without hiring third-party Merchants, you can do so and there are only two wallets involved in the process: the wallet with your coins (Owner), which can remain offline, and the wallet running in a server online 24/7 that will act both as Merchant and Merchantnode and will stake your coins. This wallet will earn the commission you set for the contract, as it is acting as a Merchant wallet. Since the minimum commission is 1%, this amount from the staking rewards would go to the Merchant+Merchantnode wallet. Most people decide to transfer this amount to his Owner's wallet once in a while.</div>
										<div class="u-margin-bottom-15">Currently it is not possible to use the same wallet to act both as the Owner and Merchant. If this was the case you would effectively eliminate the Merchant entity, and the Owner's wallet would receive 100% of the rewards while the Merchantnode does the staking. It would be similar to the Masternode process.</div>
										<div class="u-margin-bottom-15">When the Owner creates the contract with the Merchant, he will receive a TPoS address. This address acts as a cold staking address, where Owner can withdraw and deposit coins to it at will. The coins in it are always staking, risk-free and without further intervention.</div>
										<div class="u-margin-bottom-15">Please check the TPoS guide here: <a href="https://medium.com/@ethminer89/stakenet-xsn-tpos-merchant-setup-guide-e4931b274cec" target="_blank">https://medium.com/@ethminer89/stakenet-xsn-tpos-merchant-setup-guide-e4931b274cec</a></div>

										<div class="u-margin-bottom-15">Atomic Swaps are trustless cross-chain trading. They allow people to trade with one another directly from their wallets, without the need and risks of intermediaries. This is revolutionary, as you no longer need to trust any centralized entity in order to buy or sell crypto assets. They work with Hashed Timelock Contracts (HTLCs), a kind of smart contract.</div>
										<div class="u-margin-bottom-15">Atomic Swaps (Cross-Chain Atomic Swaps), are done on-chain. This means they are limited by block size (not scalable), confirmation times (slow), and fees (expensive) inherent to the respective blockchains.</div>
										<div class="u-margin-bottom-15">Lightning Swaps (Lightning Network Cross-Chain Atomic Swaps) are done off-chain over Lightning Network. Lightning Swaps are infinitely scalable, instant, and have little to no fees at all. So they don't have any of the on-chain Atomic Swaps limitations.</div>
										<div class="u-margin-bottom-15">With the issues on-chain Atomic Swaps have, it is clear why Decentralized Exchanges haven't gained enough traction so far, they simply can't match the user experience of Centralized Exchanges. Lightning Swaps solve all of these major problems, so they could very well revolutionize the entire ecosystem.</div>
										<div class="u-margin-bottom-15">The possibilities that arise are limitless, and considering the huge progress the developers working on the Bitcoin-Lightning (BTC/LN) protocol are making, it is clear to us that it is the future. That is why Stakenet is leading on Lightning Network innovation, and it is among the first three, next to Bitcoin and Litecoin, to ever perform Lightning Swaps.</div>
										<div class="u-margin-bottom-15">In December 2018, the head developers of Stakenet formalized a collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation to work on and further develop the Lightning Network.</div>

								</div>
								<div class="c-collapse__content">
										<div class="u-margin-bottom-15">Stakenet is one of the most secure PoS blockchains. In order to perform an attack, you would need to own more than 50% of the current online staking supply. At this moment there are around 25 000 000 XSN staking. This represents 50% of the total stakeable coins (coins not locked in Masternodes), a pretty impressive figure thanks to Trustless Proof of Stake (TPoS). This is multiple magnitudes higher than other PoS blockchains.</div>
										<div class="u-margin-bottom-15">Therefore, you would need to own half of those 25 000 000 XSN currently staking, that's around 12 500 000 XSN. On the other hand, if you couldn't buy any of those currently staking coins, you would then need to buy more than 25 000 000 XSN (the current staking amount + 1).</div>
										<div class="u-margin-bottom-15">So the attacker would need to own between 12 500 000 XSN and 25 000 000 XSN to successfully attack Stakenet. That's between 17% and 34% of the total circulating supply. If more coins were to be staking, or more supply to be locked in Masternodes -and developers are working towards that happening-, there might not be enough supply available to purchase to perform the attack at all.</div>
										<div class="u-margin-bottom-15">This kind of attack would require to invest and lose an insane amount of money, time (many years) and effort, to no benefit at all.</div>
										<div class="u-margin-bottom-15">Even in the worst case scenario of someone acquiring the XSN needed to perform this attack, the bad actor will stake, but he won't be able to do much as he can't write every block or fake any transactions. He can't generate two copies of the chain for longer than 20 blocks (our confirmation time), as there's a built-in mechanism (coinage) where coins become immature, thus decreasing the chance of the attacker of minting a new block on each generated block. A double spend won't occur because one block will be dropped in the event of multiple blocks. The most they can do is simply mint empty blocks - and the next blocks will include the transactions anyway, so developers would probably just put a measure in to stop empty blocks from being accepted. For example, wall off coins linked to empty blocks as a new upgrade or fork version.</div>
										<div class="u-margin-bottom-15">Something else to keep in mind is that Proof of Stake doesn't allow pre-minting, so they can't generate the next block without generating the previous block. And there is network drift and difficulty as block inputs. They would need to continuously mint 20 blocks on both chains - the chances of that happening with the systems in place are close to none.</div>
										<div class="u-margin-bottom-15">Taking into account everything previously stated, we can conclude the chances of such attack happening are essentially zero and Stakenet is among the most secure blockchains in the industry.</div>

										<div class="u-margin-bottom-15">Becoming a TPoS Merchant is purposely made easy. This will ensure competition and enough decentralization amongst TPoS Merchants to prevent a single Merchant from monopolizing the market.</div>
										<div class="u-margin-bottom-15">Furthermore, as the setup is fairly easy, a lot of the people just choose to run their own Merchantnode to cold stake their coins and not pay a commission to a third party. This is especially true with people that own large amounts of XSN.</div>
										<div class="u-margin-bottom-15">So it is simply not possible to gather the vast amount of XSN needed to perform this attack using Merchantnodes, as most of the coins are being staked by their Owners directly, and you are competing against dozens of other Merchants. After making a lot of marketing efforts and noise, at best you could gather a few hundred thousand XSN by offering Merchant services, nothing in the grand scheme of things where you'd still need to buy between 12.5M and 25M XSN.</div>
										<div class="u-margin-bottom-15">The developer team also can work on one-click TPoS setups for Merchant UI’s if need be to even further ensure decentralization and allow average non-techies to enter the market.</div>

Set up your Masternode risk-free, as you remain in control of your coins at all times in your wallet.</td></tr><tr><td>· Monitoring services for Masternodes and TPoS contracts. Receive e-mail alerts if anything goes wrong.</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
										<div class="u-margin-bottom-15">XSN Cloud collects fees from the users for using these services. Fees are then sent to the Stakenet treasury to cover costs and further developments.</div>
										<div class="u-margin-bottom-15">Note that you lose ownership of the coins you deposit to XSN Cloud wallets, as you don't control the private keys. Please do not deposit large amounts of coins to the Cloud wallets, but instead stake on your own with TPoS or common staking solutions, as the profitability will be higher and there will be no risks associated.</div>
										<div class="u-margin-bottom-15">XSN Cloud wallets are only suitable for newcomers with no experience and a low XSN balance that otherwise wouldn't earn any staking rewards for months - and we can't recommend everyone enough to move to a cold staking solution like TPoS as soon as possible.
