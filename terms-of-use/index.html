            <p>
            •&nbsp;&nbsp;after Stakenet.io terminates services to you;<br>
            •&nbsp;&nbsp;you allegedly register or register in any other person’s name as Stakenet.io user again, directly or indirectly;<br>
            •&nbsp;&nbsp;the information that you have provided is untruthful, inaccurate, outdated or incomplete;<br>

          </div>
          <p>Should the account be terminated, the account &amp; transactional information required for meeting data retention standards will be securely stored for five years. In addition, if a transaction is unfinished during the account termination process, Stakenet.io shall have the right to notify your counterparty of the situation at that time.
